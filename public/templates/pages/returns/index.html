				<h3>Order Tracking</h3>
				<p>
				All Domestic (US) orders will be emailed a tracking number to the email address provided at the time of purchase. You can use this tracking number to determine the location and estimated delivery time on your package by visiting the USPS.com Track and Confirm page. Please note that USPS can take up to 12 hours after the order is shipped to provide accurate tracking information. </p>
				<p>Orders placed after 9am on Friday will ship the next business day (Monday), regardless of the shipping option chosen.</p>
				<p>All International First Class orders are provided a Customs Declaration Number to identify your package at Customs, which is different than a Domestic Tracking number. Please do not use this number to track on USPS.com as USPS will not track International Packages. Canadian Priority mail will be provided a partially trackable Customs Declaration Number that will allow for the recipient to determine if the package has cleared Canadian Customs, however USPS will not track the order past this point.</p>

				<h3>Returns and Exchanges</h3>
				<p>Did we make a mistake? If there was an error packaging your order, we will do whatever it takes to make sure that you receive the correct item. We won't settle for anything less than 100% customer satisfaction.</p>
				<p>Do you need to send the shirt back to us for a refund or exchange? It's easy! Please contact us through email and we will be happy to assist you in getting the wrong order back to us.</p>
				<p>We offer three different return/exchange options:<p>
					<ol>
					<li>Refunds: Request a refund minus any applicable shipping costs.</li>
					<li>Exchange without New Purchase: You are welcome to send the item back and request an exchange for an item of equal or lesser value.  If you are exchanging for an item of greater value than the item returned, please include a note with your personal email so we can send an invoice.</li>
					<li>Exchange with New Purchase: You are welcome to exchange by ordering a new item online and then send the item that is no longer wanted back for a refund minus shipping.  For this option you will need to include a copy of the new Invoice Number with the return.</li>
					</ol>
