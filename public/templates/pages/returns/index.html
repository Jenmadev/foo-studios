				<h3>Order Tracking</h3>
				<p>
				All Domestic (US) orders will be emailed a tracking number to the email address provided at the time of purchase. You can use this tracking number to determine the location and estimated delivery time on your package by visiting the USPS.com Track and Confirm page. Please note that USPS can take up to 12 hours after the order is shipped to provide accurate tracking information. </p>

				<p>Orders placed after 9am on Friday will ship the next business day (Monday), regardless of the shipping option chosen.</p>

				<p>All International First Class orders are provided a Customs Declaration Number to identify your package at Customs, which is different than a Domestic Tracking number. Please do not use this number to track on USPS.com as USPS will not track International Packages. Canadian Priority mail will be provided a partially trackable Customs Declaration Number that will allow for the recipient to determine if the package has cleared Canadian Customs, however USPS will not track the order past this point.</p>
